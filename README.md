# Global Connectivity Initiative

## Overview
The **Global Connectivity Initiative** aims to bridge the growing digital divide by creating a sustainable funding model. This project reallocates wealth from affluent regions, where high-speed internet is already established, to support internet infrastructure development in underdeveloped regions. The model utilizes **cryptocurrency mining** and **machine learning** for optimized resource allocation, ensuring maximum impact for internet access expansion in underserved areas.

## Problem Statement
- **Affluent Regions**: High internet costs but little need for further infrastructure investment.
- **Underdeveloped Regions**: Low internet penetration, poor infrastructure, and high funding needs.
  
The digital divide continues to grow, and existing solutions are either too costly or inefficient. Our project offers a scalable and sustainable approach to funding internet development.

## Solution
We introduce a funding model where users in affluent regions pay a premium fee on their monthly internet bill. A portion of this fee is allocated to **cryptocurrency mining**. The mined cryptocurrency is then used to fund internet development projects in underdeveloped regions. **Machine learning** is used to optimize resource allocation, ensuring the funds are used in the most impactful way.

## Features
- **Sustainable funding model**: A system that generates funds over time through cryptocurrency mining.
- **Resource optimization**: Machine learning algorithms help prioritize where funds are allocated based on the regions with the greatest need for infrastructure.
- **Global reach**: The project is designed to scale, making a significant impact in bridging the digital divide globally.

## Technologies Used
- **Cryptocurrency** (for funding via mining)
- **Blockchain** (for transparency and security)
- **Machine Learning** (for optimized resource allocation)
- **Cloud Computing** (for scalable infrastructure)
- **Data Analytics** (for assessing and monitoring the impact)
